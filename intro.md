# Node.js

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that enables developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. It was created by Ryan Dahl using the Chrome V8 engine.

## Introduction

Node.js allows developers to create both console-based and web-based applications, making it versatile for various use cases.

## Core Node Modules

- **fs (File System):** Helps manage files and directories, allowing reading from, writing to, and manipulation of file systems.
  
- **http:** Enables the creation of web servers and clients, facilitating the building and interaction with websites and web services.
  
- **path:** Provides utilities for handling file paths, simplifying file management tasks such as joining or resolving paths.
  
- **events:** Allows working with events in Node.js, enabling the creation and handling of custom events for more responsive and interactive code.

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM, short for Node Package Manager, serves as a package manager for Node.js.

- **Package Definition (package.json):** All npm packages are defined in `package.json` files, written in JSON format.
  
- **Required Fields:** The `package.json` file must contain at least two fields: `name` and `version`.
  
### Example `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "description": "A package for fooing things",
  "main": "foo.js",
  "keywords": ["foo", "fool", "foolish"],
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "ISC"
}

```

## Dependencies and DevDependencies

### Dependencies

- Dependencies are the packages that your project needs to run properly in a production environment.
- They include libraries and tools essential for your application to work as intended when deployed.
- Examples of dependencies:
  - Frameworks like React or Express
  - Database drivers
  - Utility libraries

### DevDependencies

- DevDependencies are the packages that are only needed during the development and testing of your project.
- They are not required when the project is deployed in a production environment.
- Examples of devDependencies:
  - Testing frameworks like Jest
  - Build tools like Webpack or Babel
  - Code quality tools like ESLint

## package.json

- This file contains metadata about your project, including its name, version, description, and entry points.
- It also lists the dependencies and devDependencies required by your project, along with their respective version ranges.
- Developers typically edit `package.json` directly to add or update dependencies and manage project settings.
- It's used by npm to install dependencies and run scripts defined in the "scripts" section.

## package-lock.json

- This file describes the exact versions of the dependencies installed in your project, including their sub-dependencies.
- It's automatically generated by npm when you run `npm install` and is updated whenever there's a change in the dependency tree.
- `package-lock.json` ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed consistently across different environments, preventing version conflicts and ensuring reproducibility.
- Developers usually don't edit `package-lock.json` directly; instead, it's managed by npm to ensure the integrity and stability of the project's dependencies.

## npm install

- This command is used to install dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
- When you run `npm install`, npm reads the dependencies and devDependencies from `package.json` and installs them into the `node_modules` directory.
- If `package-lock.json` exists, npm will use it to ensure that the exact versions of dependencies specified in `package-lock.json` are installed.

## npm ci

- This command stands for "clean install" and is typically used in continuous integration (CI) environments or for reproducible builds.
- `npm ci` installs dependencies based on the exact versions specified in the `package-lock.json` file, ignoring the `package.json` file's dependency ranges.
- It's faster and more reliable than `npm install` for automated builds because it doesn't need to calculate dependency ranges.

## npm audit

- This command checks your project's dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
- When you run `npm audit`, npm analyzes your project's dependency tree and compares it against a database of known vulnerabilities.
- It provides a report detailing any vulnerabilities found, along with recommended actions to fix them.
- `npm audit` is a valuable tool for ensuring the security of your project and keeping your dependencies up to date.

## npm init

- This command initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file.
- When you run `npm init`, npm will prompt you to answer a series of questions to set up your project's metadata, such as its name, version, description, entry point, and test command.
- Once you've answered the questions, npm will generate a `package.json` file based on your inputs, which you can then customize further if needed.
